        <p>
            I conducted this electronic waste survey in the month of May 2021. During that
            time majority of India was in lockdown because of the second wave of the Coronavirus 
            pandemic. I wanted to see what people’s basic awareness about Electronic waste and 
            its disposal was and if I could help educate anyone on the harmful effects of E-waste. 
            So I conducted a survey. I received over 100 responses from numerous people,
            in different countries. India, United States of America, England, Nepal, Spain,
            Singapore, Canada, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, South Africa, 
            Wales, and Puerto Rico – are some of the countries from where I received responses. 
            Seeing what people’s awareness of E-waste is and how it is different for each country 
            was truly enlightening.
