        <img src="images/reading.png" alt="">
        <p>I love reading all kinds of books- fiction, mystery, novels, thrillers, etc. 
            To me, books are one of my dearest friends. Books can provide comfort, yet 
            make you experience a whole new set of feelings you thought weren't possible. 
            I often get lost in the enticing stories I read and recommend reading to 
            everyone.</p>
